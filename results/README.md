# Periapical Lesion Detection - Training Outputs and Visualizations

This directory contains the outputs and visualizations from training the YOLOv8-based periapical lesion detection model.

## Metrics

| Metric       | Value  |
|-------------|--------|
| mAP@0.5     | 80.7%  |
| Precision   | 82.3%  |
| Recall      | 73.1%  |

## Notes
- The metrics above are calculated on the validation set.
- Visualizations include loss curves, precision-recall curves, and sample detection outputs.
